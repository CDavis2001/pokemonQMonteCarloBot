# Pokemon Q Learning Monte Carlo Agent
This repository contains all code written for the project in my third year studying Computer Science at the University of Warwick (2020-23)
The title of the project is Combining Reinforcement Learning and Monte Carlo Search Algorithms for Pok√©mon Battling. The aim is to develop a set of agents that can be used for Pokemon Battles on Pokemon Showdown that use Q learning and later transition to using Monte Carlo search and evaluate them against each other, some simple bots and against human players.
